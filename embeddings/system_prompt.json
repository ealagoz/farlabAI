management plan for liquid and vapour isotope measurements Description: This is the University of Bergen's FARLAB Data management plan for liquid and vapour isotope measurements. Category: FARLAB operational protocols and safety Link: https://farlabprotocols.wiki.uib.no/Data_management_plan_for_liquid_and_vapour_isotope_measurements", "Content: FARLAB UiB This is the University of Bergen's FARLAB main website. Facility for advanced isotopic research and monitoring of weather, climate and biogeochemical cycling (FARLAB) is Norway\u2019s national light stable isotope facility, run by the GEO and GFI departments at the University of Bergen. At FARLAB we employ the latest analytical tools, including flight, field, seagoing and laboratory based instrumentation, to measure isotopes of e.g. H, C, N, O, S as well as isotope clumping in carbonates.  Using these instruments, together with ongoing efforts to develop and refine methods and improve calibration and international standardization, FARLAB aims to foster important breakthroughs in Earth System understanding. By analyzing isotopes of e.g. atmospheric water, carbonates, seawater and its dissolved carbon, biological materials, among others, FARLAB addresses cardinal problems in climate, weather, biogeochemistry, and earth science related fields. The applications are not limited to these fields and, due to its critical mass of expertise and equipment, FARLAB is highly flexible and can develop tailored analyses to Norwegian and international researchers. Another key mission of FARLAB is to act as a national hub for training. We work to foster the exchange on state-of-the-art analytical expertise across Norway. Contact us about support for visiting researcher and training opportunities. Water isotopes FARLAB UiB's water isotopes page with information on how to submit samples for analysis. Lab Analysis: https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB/119783/water-isotopes Sample material: rain water, sea water, snow, glacier ice, ground water, river runoff Precision: typically < 0.1 permil for \u03b4D and < 0.025 permil for \u03b418O Instrument: Picarro L2140-i with Vapourizer and Autosampler Sample requirements: min. 1.5 ml sample liquid in evaporation-proof container Routines: options from fast method (6 injections per sample) to low memory (12 injections per sample) for high-precision d-excess measurements For analysis of \u03b418O, \u03b417O, and \u03b4D in water, samples are filtered, if needed, with 25mm Nylon filters with a 0.2 \u03bcm PTFE membrane (part #514-0066, VWR, USA), and transferred to 1.5 ml glass vials with rubber/PTFE septa (part #548-0907, VWR, USA). An autosampler (A0325, Picarro Inc) transferred ca. 2\u03bcl per injection into a high-precision vapourizer (A0211, Picarro Inc, USA) heated to 110\u00b0C. After blending with dry N2 \u202f(< 5 ppm H2O) the gas mixture was directed into the measurement cavity of a Cavity-Ring Down Spectrometer (L2140-i, Picarro Inc) for about 7 min with a typical water concentration of 20 000 ppm. Memory effects are reduced by two times measuring a vapour mixture at a mixing ratio of about 50 000 ppm, obtained from 2 injections of about 2 \u03bcl of sample for 5 min at the beginning of each new sample vial. Thereafter, another 6-12 injections of about 2 \u03bcl per sample are measured individually as described above, and averages of the last 3 to 4 injections are used for further processing. Several laboratory standards are measured at the beginning and end of each batch. Batches consist typically of 20 samples, including a drift standard measured every 5 samples. For calibration according to IAEA recommendations, at least two laboratory standards matching the range of the samples are used. During calibration, linear drift of the analyser during the time it takes to run the batch is assumed. Long-term measurement precision is 0.15 \u2030 for \u03b4D and 0.02 \u2030 for \u03b418O, resulting in a measurement precision of 1.0 \u2030 for d-excess. The method for \u03b417O-excess is still under development.

Sample sizes and other requirements may vary greatly on the sample material and the experiment requirements. We recommend that you contact us for discussion and advice about ideal sample sizes. Routines: Sample preparation depends greatly on type of sample and purpose of analyses. Generally, all samples are homogenized (e.g. by grinding in a mortar) and dried (60-80\u00b0C). \u202fSoils, sediments, rocks or animals containing carbonates needs carbonate removal \u202f(acid washing) \u202fbefore \u202fanalysis of \u202f\u03b413C \u202fin organic C. One might also want to remove fat from tissue with significant fat as fats and proteins often have different \u202f\u03b413C.\u202f For particulate organic carbon samples or other samples collected on filters, C, N and S free filters must be used, preferably ignited quarts filters. Samples are then weighed\u202f (0.1 - 10 mg depending on material) \u202finto tin or silver capsules\u202fbefore analyses. \u202fThe capsules are dropped into a furnace containing metallic catalysts at 1020\u00b0C \u202fwith a pulse of O2 \u202fwhere samples oxidize \u202fto \u202fCO2, \u202fN\u202foxides and SO2. The gasses are passed through a reactor with reduced copper reducing Noxides to N2 \u202fand a water trap. The gasses are separated in a packed GC column before they are passed to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer.

Lab Analysis: https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB/125005/%CE%B418o-and-%CE%B413c-carbonate Sample material: carbonates (e.g. foraminifera, corals, otoliths, spaleothems, inorganic precipitates, human/animal tooth & bone, etc.) Precision: long term external precision (1standard deviation) is normally 0.02-0.03\u2030 for \u03b413C and 0.06-0.08\u2030 for \u03b418O in samples between 10-100 mg. Instrument: Thermo Scientific MAT253 and online Kiel IV carbonate device with microvolume. Gasbench-Delta V and/or DeltaRay may be used for slower reacting carbonates (e.g. dolomite). \u03b413C and \u03b418O are acquired simultaneously from each sample analyzed. Sample requirements: we typically request \u226520mg of carbonate but have run with high precision down to 5 mg. Sample sizes can vary greatly depending upon the material and the experimental requirements. We recommend you contact us so that we can discuss and provide advice regarding the ideal sample size for meeting your specific requirements. Routines: most samples are analyzed on the dedicated MAT253-Kiel IV system. Cleaning/purification of sample carbonate may be required, and the specific methods depend upon the material to be analyzed. Dry carbonate is weighed into individual Kiel vials. The Kiel IV automatically reacts cleaned carbonate samples in a vacuum with phosphoric acid, H2O is removed and the resulting CO2 is dried cryogenically (H2O removed) and concentrated in a microvolume for analysis. Each run takes approximately one day and contains around 36 sample aliquots and 10 standards. Masses 44-46 are measured. The data are transferred into the absolute reference frame (\u2030VPDB) using international carbonate standards (e.g. NBS-19, NBS-18) and an in-house control standard for assessing long-term stability and external precision. The Delta Ray CO2 isotope analyzer is equipped with a universal reference inlet and autosampler with heated sample tray for temperature controlled reaction of carbonates with phosphoric acid. The system is able to provide high precision measurements in the laboratory and in the field, for example when deployed on a ship for isotope results in near real time during scientific expeditions. Analysis request form: https://skjemaker.app.uib.no/view.php?id=5180257 \u03b413C of dissolved inorganic carbon FARLAB UiB's \u03b413C of dissolved inorganic carbon page with information on how to submit samples for analysis. Lab Analysis: \u03b413C of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon in water samples is measured on a Gasbench II connected to a Thermo Scientific Delta V plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer or a URI-connect, Thermo Scientific Delta Ray isotope ratio infrared spectrometer in either the field or the lab. The analysis is done by acidifying 0.5 - 1 ml (depending on TCO2) of water in a flushed exetainer, allowing the CO2 to diffuse into the vial headspace. The headspace CO2 is then purged into the analyser through the relevant inlet and compared to an internal reference gas. The samples are calibrated against internationally distributed standards. Samples are normally analyzed in triplicate. Samples must be collected in full glass vials with gas-tight caps. Samples must be sterilized (typically by HgCl2 or acidification) to avoid microbial C turnover, which will alter C isotope composition, and stored refrigerated. Typically, this would be serum vials with crimp caps and HgCl2, or preflushed 12 ml exetainers with acid in replicates (contact us for details if needed). Results are reported as \u2030 on VPDB scale.  Normal external precision is \u22640.1 \u2030 (\u03b413C) with significantly better precision achieved for many types of samples. Analysis request form: https://skjemaker.app.uib.no/view.php?id=5180257 Clumped isotopes in carbonates and CO2 FARLAB UiB's Clumped isotopes in carbonates and CO2 page with information on how to submit samples for analysis. Lab Analysis: https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB/119787/clumped-isotopes-carbonates-and-co2 Sample material: Carbonates or CO2 Precision: Typical external precision on \ud835\udee547 for 80-100 \u00b5g carbonates is 0.03 \u2030 (1 SD) Instrument: Thermo Scientific MAT 253Plus with Kiel IV carbonate preparation device Sample requirements: Samples need to be free of organics and halogens. Foraminifera samples are cleaned with DI water and methanol under sonication. Routines: Typically, 15-40 replicates (depending on desired precision) are measured per sample, distributed over longer measurement periods. Clumped isotopes in carbonates and CO2 are measured using dedicated Thermo Scientific MAT253Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometers coupled to Kiel IV carbonate preparation devices. This instrumentation allows us to minimize sample size requirements for carbonate samples. For carbonates, small (~ 100 \u00b5g) aliquots are weighed into individual Kiel vials. The samples are automatically reacted with phosphoric acid and the resulting CO2 is purified for water with a cold trap, as well as organic contaminants using an in-line Porapak trap. Each run takes approximately one day and contains around 20 sample aliquots and an equal number of clumped isotope carbonate standards (ETH 1-4). Masses 44-49 are measured in microvolume mode, and results are corrected for pressure baseline effects. The data are transferred into the absolute reference frame using three of the carbonate standards, with the fourth being used as control. For a reliable clumped isotope (\ud835\udee547) value, results from several (10-40) aliquots need to be averaged. The number of replicates depends on the desired precision. Besides \ud835\udee547, the analyses yield \ud835\udeff13C and \ud835\udeff18O for each aliquot. All data processing is performed using the Easotope software (https://easotope.org). Pre-processing of carbonate samples depends on the sample type. For example, speleothem calcite can typically be weighed in directly. Foraminifera require gentle ultrasonic cleaning with deionized water and methanol, with the number of cleaning steps depending on the sample. Organic-rich samples need to be cleaned with an oxidative treatment prior to analysis and need to be free of halogens. Larger carbonate samples or those requiring higher reaction temperatures or additional cleaning can be reacted offline in glass vessels and processed on the glass vacuum line. Clumped isotopes in CO2 are measured by transferring the sample directly into the sample bellow of the dual inlet. The CO2 is purified on the vacuum line for water and organic contaminants prior to analysis.

Sample preparation depends on the starting material and purpose of analysis. Currently we are developing the preparation protocols for extracting leaf waxes from lake sediments. Typically, 1 \u03bcl samples are injected with an injector and GC temperature of 40\u00b0C. The injector as ramped to 320\u00b0C while the CG is kept at 40\u00b0C for 1 min. The GC is then ramped to 320 \u00b0C with a total runtime of 1h 15min. The n-alkanes are separated on a GC column and passed to a conditioned alumina pyrolysis (1420\u00b0C) or combustion (1030\u00b0C) furnace for \u03b4D or \u03b413C analyses respectively.

This instrument is dedicated for \u03b418O, \u03b413C analyses of carbonates. The system has been optimized to run low mass carbonate samples, allowing us to obtain high-precision isotopic results from systems where sample size was previously considered a limiting factor. Examples include the ability to analyze individual specimens or chambers of foraminifera, generate continuous down core isotopic records in high-sedimentation rate or polar settings where carbonate is scarce, and resolve high temporal fidelity in systems such as otoliths, bivalves or sclerosponges. Delta V with Gasbench, EA, GC FARLAB UiB's Delta V with Gasbench, EA, GC instrument page. Web: https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB/119768/delta-v-gasbench-ea-gc The lab has two Thermo Fisher Scientific Delta V Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometers set up for continuous flow analyses. The mass spectrometers are set up with different peripherals. One Delta V plus is coupled to a Gasbench II, which is an on-line preparation and introduction system for \u03b418O of water samples, \u03b413C of dissolved inorganic carbon in water and \u03b413C and \u03b418O in carbonates. A second peripheral for this instrument is a Precon with a Trace GC for analysing the stable C, N and O isotopes of trace gas concentrations of CH4 and N2O respectively. The second Delta V plus is coupled to a Thermo Scientific Isolink GC with a Gerstel CIS 6 PTV injector. This is mainly dedicated to \u03b4D and \u03b413C analyses of N-alkanes and gasses. The setup and methods are optimized for n-alkanes of leaf waxes from lake sediments. The mass spectrometer is also coupled to a Flash 1120 Elemental Analyzer for analysing nitrogen and carbon isotopes in solids, covering a wide range of sample types and a Thermo Scientific Flash HT set up for \u03b4D, \u03b418O and \u03b434S analyses of solids. MAT253Plus and Kiel IV FARLAB UiB's MAT253Plus and Kiel IV instrument page. Web: https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB/119771/mat253plus-and-kiel-iv Two identical systems are set up for clumped isotope analyses. These instruments have been acquired with funding from the Trond Mohn Foundation, the European Research Council, and the Norwegian Research Council. Measurements yield \u03b418O, \u03b413C, and \u03b447, needed to calculate \ud835\udee547 (excess abundance of doubly substituted carbonate, relative to stochastic). The Kiel devices are equipped with custom-made purification columns for organic contaminants. In FARLAB, we focus on minimizing sample size, important when using material like fossil foraminifera from marine sediment cores. The Kiel device allows automated individual processing of small (~100 \u00b5g) sample aliquots. A number of these are then averaged to obtain a temperature estimate. Aliquots can be splits of a bigger sample, or taken from individual samples (e.g., sediment layers).

Web: https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB/124948/measurements-picarro Picarro analyzers use time-based, optical absorption spectroscopy of the target gases to determine concentration or isotopic composition (Fig. 1). If you have any questions how to operate, analyze data, maintain or troubleshooting the water analyzer read the user\u2019s manual \u201cOperation, maintenance and troubleshooting L2140-I, L2130-I or L2120-I analyzer and Peripherals User\u2019s manual\u201d: 1. Place the sample vials with the port septa caps upwards in the Picarro trey in the same order as the sample list (the autosample goes from the left to the right). 2. Manually clean the syringe or exchange the defect syringe with a new one. How to clean syringe: a) Press \u201cChange syringe\u201d in autosampler window. b) Take the syringe out from the autosample. c) Clean it with distilled (DI) water, acetone, ethanol and again with DI water (10-20   injections for saltwater and 5 injection for freshwater). d) If the syringe plunger does not move smoothly through the barrel, carefully spin the plunger with your fingertip. NB! Be careful to NOT pull out the plunger aggressively of the syringe. This can cause the syringe plunger to crumple. e) Re-insert the syringe carefully back in the autosample by manually depress the metal block holding the syringe. f) If the syringe is clogged in the middle of a run: Go to Autosample window and press \u201cStop\u201d and then \u201cChange syringe.\u201d g) Clean the syringe by carefully injecting DI water from another syringe to increase t he pressure at the tip. h) Repeat c)-e) if the syringe is clogged. i) Click on \u201cSwap on\u201d. If you cleaned the syringe in the middle of a run press \u201cResume\u201d and then \u201cStart\u201d. 3. Replace the dirty line/salt trap with a clean one (does not apply for freshwater Picarro HKDS2038)  and change/clean salt from the port septum with tap water and wipe it with kim wips How to change the salt line and port septum: a) Remove the protective metal cover/wrench around the injection port and unscrew the cap of the port only with the wrench supplied on the vaporizer. WARNING! THE BOTTOM OF THE CAP IS VERY HOT. b) Take out the septum (that usually sticks to the salt line) and the salt line with a tweezers. c) Replace the dirty salt trap with a clean one and make sure the rubber seal/o-ring is in placebefore placing the clean salt line back into the injection port. d) Insert a clean/new septum into the cap. e) Screw the cap by hand. Fingertight. CAUTION! DO NOT USE THE WRENCH. d) Place the metal cover around the injection port. 4. Make sure the temperature stabilizes at 110 \u00baC. 5. Control the pressure of nitrogen (the dry gas should be right below 0,20 bar). Dry nitrogen should be supplied to the instrument to achieve the appropriate injection concentration. The best results of injections of liquid sample should provide a concentration around 19-21 000 \u00b1 1000 ppmv to the instrument. The data will be available in the graphical user interface (GUI) as pulses in the CRDS data viewer wi ndow. Adjust the syringe injection volume in autosampler window (method) if needed. The injection volume is influenced by different syringe. For a quick check on current syringe volume choose \u201cHigh throughput\u201c in the Coordinator launcher.  At the moment the injection volume is 1.6 \u00b5lon the saltwater Picarro to reach 20 000 ppm. 6. Return to the Autosampler window to control the boxes/fields in \"job queue\" and change method/parameters for your analysis if needed (Fig. 2). The current method is running 12 samples (two blocks of samples). 10 injections (4 wet flush injections and 6 sample injections) are run per sample and 16 injections (4 wet flush injections and 12 standard injections) are run per standard. To prevent memory affects DI water is run after each block of samples 7. Make sure the pipette is injecting the septa cap and the injection port in a right position. Bad injections can clog the needle and damage vaporizer septum, which cause incorrect concentration peak. 8. Close the Coordinator window before you open it again by double-click on the \u201cCoordinator launcher\u201d icon at the desktop. Choose your coordinator of interest (High prec double wet peak) and then press launch. Wait until the lower part of the window signalize that the vaporizer is cleaned and you can start wet flushing. 9. Return to the Autosampler window and press \u201cRun\u201d. 10. Return to Coordinator window to load/reload the sample description file by clicking on \u201cload sample descriptions\u201d (sample list). T his allows the user to include descriptions for each vial in the data file output on the coordinator window (Identifier 1 & 2). You can load the sample description files at any time during the data collection. NB!The file must be in comma separated value (CSV) format. From the Coordinate window, you will be able to see the results from the sample analysis, see the current status of your analyzer and load sample descriptions. In the upper portion of the window each row represents the analysis results from a single injection. The lower portion of the window displays the action that is currently taking place. (\u201cNew output fil button\u201d is used to save the data that you see on the coordinator window into a file, and then clear the data from the coordinator window.) 11. Go to Notepad ++ software (Note picarro-L2140i-HKDS2039-log) at the desktop to log your run and then click \"Save\" to confirm. 12. For saltwater Picarro, make sure it is a clean salt line for the next run. Take the beaker with dirty lines to Prep-lab (TC15a). Rinse the beaker with DI water before putting the beaker in an ultrasound bath for about 3 minutes. Rinse the salt line again in DI water before putting the beaker in the hot oven (70 degree). When it\u00b4s clean and dry place the clean salt lines into the plastic box in CF-lab (TE15d). Weighing procedure with microbalances FARLAB UiB's weighing procedure with microbalances routines and protocols page. Web: https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB/124964/weighing-procedure-microbalances NB! only trained/approved users may use the microbalances, never exceed the maximum weight range for a given balance. Write yourself on the list/check if the microbalance is available. Clean the working bench and weighing equipment with Kim Wipes/brush. Check that the weighing pan is clean. If it is not, clean VERY carefully with a brush, contact Anna Kieu-Diem Tran if unsure how to remove contamination. Avoid jarring or vibrating the balance. Do not place vials, racks or other equipment on the anti-vibration table or on top of the microscale to prevent destabilizing the balance. Cover open vials on the bench with plastic sheet or clean paper to prevent dust from falling in. Standards can be found in the standard desiccator. If the standard is in a bottle with cap: Open the bottle only when you remove standard out of it with a clean small spatula and close it immediately after use. DO NOT PUT MATERIAL BACK INTO THE STANDARD BOTTLE AND NEVER POUR STANDARD OUT Carefully place an empty weighing boat or weighing paper onto the balance using tweezers (do not touch with your fingers). Be careful to not press down on the weighing pan! Never put samples directly onto the weighing pan. Take the balance. Take the weighing boat out again and place standard/sample material in the middle of the weighing boat/paper. Place the weighing boat/paper with standard/sample onto the balance again. Close the draft shield before reading the result. If the weight is too large: remove the boat from the microscale and pick/pour the extra grains out on a tray/weighing paper. You can reuse the material if the tray/paper is clean. Read the result only after the small round circle in the upper left of the balance display has disappeared. Make sure the Kiel vial/exetainer is clean before you carefully lead the boat towards the bottom of the vial in a horizontal position. Turn the vial and boat in a vertical position before pouring and carefully knocking the boat towards the wall to ensure that all material is located in the vial. Take the boat out of the vial and weight the boat again to double-check that it is no material left in the boat. Tap the vial with a tweezer to collect the material at the bottom. For weighing out a new type of standard use a brush and Kim Wipes to clean the weighing boat and tray or change weighing paper. Place the standard back in the desiccator as soon as you are finished. Once you are done, clean after yourself! Protocols and Routines FARLAB UiB's main measurement protocols and routines page.

Therefore DO NOT take the elevator with these containers. Use the stairs while the tanks is taking the lift. Memory reduction Memory between liquid injections is one of the prime concerns with spectroscopic water isotope measurements. Liquid remaining in the measurement system on tubing walls, filters and other parts is removed over several injections, increasing time demand, cost and reducing precision. We explore and evaluate different methods to reduce memory, by modifying the sample precision software, injections methods, coating of parts of the analyser and accessories. Results are continuously made available to the public in a FARLAB report series. Vapour calibration Raw vapour measurements are first corrected for humidity dependency using an isotope-dependent humidity dependency correction developed at FARLAB (Weng and Sodemann, in prep.). Calibration of vapour data is based on the recommendations by the IAEA (2009). Standards bracketing a measurement period (typically 24h) are identified and quality-checked. Calibration interpolates then linearly in time between both standard measurements. Data are archived in a netCDF data format, including metadata on sampling and calibration procedures.

Liquid calibration with FLIIMP Calibration of liquid measurements is performed following recommendations by the IAEA (2009). The calibration procedure, including selection of samples and control of instrument parameters has been implemented into a processing package named FLIIMP (FARLAB Liquid Isotope Measurement Processor). FLIIMP reports raw and calibrated data in HTML format and data tables in CSV format for further processing. FLIIMP will be made available on the FARLAB website as open-access software after completed quality check procedures.

Projects FARLAB UiB's projects description page. Web: https://www.uib.no/en/FARLAB/119782/examples-projects#paleothermometry-paleoclimate-nbsp- SNOWPACE project field campaign In February and March 2018, FARLAB water isotope instrumentation was for the first time deployed in a comprehensive field campaign. The NFR project SNOWPACE (https://www.uib.no/en/rg/meten/109877/snowpace) and the international Iceland-Greenland Seas Project provided the scientific framework for a parallel deployment of vapour isotope measurements on board of R/V Alliance and the research aircraft MASIN from the British Antarctic Survey. The ship and aircraft encountered harsh and adverse weather conditions requiring full concentration by crew and scientists. These were however the weather conditions desired by the scientific team, allowing to probe the local water cycle north of Iceland during cold-air outbreaks on extended periods. In addition to the vapour measurements, a comprehensive set of freshwater and sea water samples have been retrieved during the campaign, including surface water samples, CTD water samples, and snow samples from two transects in northern Iceland which have been analysed at FARLAB. All instruments, sample protocols and data processing worked satisfactorily, demonstrating the field-going freshwater isotope component of FARLAB is now on an operational level. Clumped isotope paleothermometry We are measuring clumped isotopes in foraminifera (microfossils) from marine sediments to reconstruct ocean temperatures through the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years) within the C4T and CLIP projects. Planktic foraminifera record sea surface temperatures whereas benthic foraminifera living at the sea floor record the temperature of deep water masses. The advantage of this temperature proxy is that it is independent of other environmental variables like changes in the composition of seawater. We can therefore also use the results to reconstruct seawater \ud835\udeff18O (in combination with \ud835\udeff18O of calcite, obtained in the same measurement) or elemental composition changes in seawater. This way, we can find out when and how ocean temperature or the size of major ice sheets changed during major climatic events in the past. We have tested the clumped isotope method for foraminifera with recent sediment samples from various locations and find good agreement with laboratory-based carbonate calibrations. We are in addition investigating potential alteration of the signal during burial of the microfossils in the sediments over long periods of time. The clumped isotope method is furthermore used in stalagmites from Borneo (T-TRAC project) and South Africa (Center of Excellence SapienCE). In stalagmites, the method can not always be used directly to reconstruct temperatures, but in such cases it is a sensitive tool for detecting kinetic fraction effects during calcite precipitation when used in combination with other methods for temperature reconstruction.

To this end, we use the Kiel device for sample preparation, dividing samples into aliquots of typically 80-100\u00b5g. Measurements are performed from the Kiel microvolume using the long integration-dual inlet (LIDI) approach, which maximizes the utilization of the sample gas. Trace gas analysis \u03b4D compound specific\u2014paleohydrology Water isotope calibration at low humidity conditions Due to non-linear instrument response and decreasing precision, low levels of humidity pose substantial challenges to stable isotope measurements in water vapour. In ambient conditions, this is particularly relevant in cold and dry conditions, such as the polar regions, with high-elevation polar regions such as Greenland and Antarctic ice caps being most challenging. Airborne measurements in polar and mid-latitude climates, but also subsidence regions are characterized by substantial changes in ambient humidity. At FARLAB, we develop and analyse new approaches to characterise the behaviour of Picarro isotope spectrometers at low humidity levels, develop calibration protocols, and assess the potential of hydrophobic silica coatings on tubing and instrument parts to improve instrument behaviour during low humidity conditions.

Safety info Read posters explaining how to use the gas regulators in the gas room. Equipment Cylinder trolley, adjustable wrench, gloves, safety shoes, leak test detector. Pressurized gas cylinders pose certain risks and they must be handled with care. Gas cylinders are heavy because they are made of metal and must withstand a high pressure. Their long and narrow shape means that they are unstable when standing and can easily tip over if they are not secured. Gas cylinders should therefore always be strapped or chained to a dedicated holder regardless of whether they are empty or full and always have the metal hood attached when they are transported and not in use. Always use a cylinder trolley when transporting gas cylinder. Only inert gasses and O2 should be stored/used in the gas room. Flammable gasses and toxic gasses should be stored in dedicated storage cabinets with a separate ventilation system. Gas cylinder tipping handling Gas cylinder dropping or tipping over can cause weaknesses or cracks in the cylinder\u2019s shell, which can give rise to a gas leak or result in explosion. Try to handle cylinder with care and avoid dropping or hitting them against anything. A damaged gas cylinder is not safe to use and must be returned. Remember to fill in and attach the declaration form when accidents happ en. Ordering gas cylinders Gas bottles are ordered through the ordering system in BasWare PM by Anna Tran (Hildegunn Almelid, Lars Evje or Eivind St\u00f8ren). An order needs to be made before 12 AM to receive a delivery (earliest) the day after. Ordered gas bottles are placed in the gas room in the basement, room KH8a, with a sign \u201cGeovitenskap\u201d and order confirmation to know who they belong to. The key to room KH8a in the basement is available in TE15b on 5th floor or ask P\u00e5l Tore/Lars Evje. Gas cylinders should immediately be moved to the gas room at the 5th floor (TE15b) and empty ones should be taken down to room KH8a to be returned. Remember to place a yellow sign around the bottle neck for returning cylinders from the Earth Science Department. Transport of gas cylinders Currently we are taking the lift with a cylinder trolley as this is considered to reduce the risk of a cylinder tipping over and the risk of a leak is small. Since the gas cylinders are more heavy than they look like it might be useful with good pair of shoes. Everyone should have training before transporting or using gas cylinders. Changing gas cylinders on gas lines There are posters explaining how to use the gas regulators in the gas room, which should be followed. The following points are worth noticing regarding changing cylinders on gas lines. Disconnecting an empty gas cylinders Gas cylinders should be replaced when the pressure gauges displayed shows approximate 5-6 Bar remaining. When the pressure falls to low the panel automatically switch to the alternative side. Connecting a new gas cylinder Written by Anna Tran 04.09.2019 Protocol for handling liquid nitrogen tanks Introduction The following protocol describes how to safely transport and fill liquid nitrogen in 150- 250 L cryogenic containers on wheels. Safety info Protect hands with cryo gloves, long sleeve shirts, wear protection glasses and put on closed shoes (not boots where liquid can splash and trapped into) when filling liquid nitrogen from the basement. Liquid nitrogen is an extremely cold material, also in a gaseous state. The vapor of liquid nitrogen can rapidly freeze skin tissue and eye fluid, resulting in cold burns, frostbite, and permanent eye damage even by brief exposure. Cold objects may also stick to the skin and tear the flesh when you attempt to free yourself. Nitrogen gas is colorless, odorless and tasteless. It can therefore not be detected by the human senses and will be breathed as if it were air. Breathing an atmosphere that contains less than 19 percent oxygen can cause dizziness and quickly result in unconsciousness and death. In the event of spillage of liquid nitrogen on a person If exposed to liquid or cold gas, restore tissue to normal body temperature, 37\u00b0C, followed by protection of the injured tissue from further damage and infection. Remove or loosen clothing that may constrict blood circulation to the frozen area. Rapid warming of the affected part is best achieved by using water at 42\u00b0C. Water should under no circumstances be over 44\u00b0C, nor should the frozen part be rubbed either before or after re warming. If a person seems to become dizzy or loses consciousness while working with liquid nitrogen, move the person to a well-ventilated area immediately. If breathing has stopped, apply artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. If in doubt contact Legevakt (phone 116 117 or 113 for emergencies). If someone get liquid nitrogen it in the eyes, call 113, wash the eyes with appropriate equipment immediately. Safety valves defects Leave the room and place \"do not enter\" sign on doors if the safety valves are continuously releasing pressure. The pressure in the tank should decrease within time if the release valve is working fine. The signs can be found in the safety cabinet. In events of frozen/broken LN2 container valve (on the wall) for filling LN2 in the basement Close the \"main valve\" (labeled and marked with a green arrow) placed back on the LN2 container next to the back door. Transporting tanks To take the tank to the basement and back up to the 5th floor: Filling is mainly performed by a trained person in the LN2 container room in the Realfagsbygget building basement. Use the metal bridge over the door step to prevent the tank from tipping. Remember to fill out your name, project no, signature, liter of liquid nitrogen used in the red \u201dgeovitenskap\u201d binder. Full tanks should be taken to the gas storage room or in an instrument room at the 5th floor as soon as possible after filling. Current instructions (for filling yourself): Equipment: Wrenches (size 19mm and 22mm), cryo gloves, ear protection, face shield, room key (hangs on the rack in the corridor on 5th floor ).

Project preparations The entire workflow during analysis of a set of samples is shown as a workflow diagram in Fig. 2. Each step is detailed further below. Figure 2: Summary of workflow during liquid sample analysis Sample handling Preparing runs/batches Running analysis for a batch 1. Create sample_description_<FARLAB_ID>_sample_description_runxx.csv The sample description is a simple text file in csv format with columns indicated below, and using comma for separation. It is most convenient to create such files with OpenOffice and to export as csv. The first indicator is the name of the sample provided by the customer, indicator2 is the FARLAB ID. In case of standards, the name is the name of the lab standard, and the indicator is composed of standard_<date of filling vial>. This allows to control the reuse of vials. Example: The sample description is loaded with the coordinator button \"load sample description\" at any time during the run (see below). 2. Log run details in instrument logfile (Picarro-L2140i-HKDS2038/9.txt) using Notepad++ Each analyzer has an electronic log file that is placed in the directory C:\\IsotopeData. The name of the file starts with the instrument type, serial number a nd ends in \"log\", for example Picarro-L2140i-HKDS2039-log.txt Every new log entry starts with information of date (YYYY-MM-DD) and a two-letter identifier of the author in brackets, followed by the time of the entry in UTC time. When several significant entries are made on the same day with a time gap in-between, only the time needs to be stated. For example: Upon preparation and starting of a run, the following details are noted: Upon completion of the run, the result (success/failure) and possible comments should be noted. Comments include change of septum, cleaning and change of syringe, and other relevant notes. Example: Run a batch on HKDS2038/HKDS2039 Figure 3: Example of a setup of the autosampler window for a freshwater run. Note the priming of the run at the beginning with 6 injections from vial #3. Figure 4: Example for a successful sequence of regular injections at about 20'000 ppmv followed by the two peaks from double peak wet flushes at the beginning of the next sample vial. Finalizing the analysis after each and after all runs Choosing the range of standards Depending on the known or expected range of the samples, the calibration standards need to be chosen. The calibration standards should bracket the range of samples as close as possible. If the samples are processed in several batches from different sources (groundwater/snow/rain), the calibration standards may be adjusted for each run. Typical combinations are: DI2 or SEAII should always b e included as the long-term drift standard of the laboratory. The sequence of the standards should be such that the jump to the first sample is minimised. For example, when measuring snow samples, the sequence would be EVAP2-DI2-GLW-Sample1 etc. Memory from samples and standards Memory is a challenge for all liquid measurements. Standards are measured with 12 injections, with 2 preceeding double-peak wet flushes, requiring in total 16 injections. Samples in contrast are commonly run with 6 effective injections, i.e. 10 injections with a double-peak wet flush. The isotope composition between the samples of one run typically varies less than the jump from the last standard and the first sample. Therefore, sample 1 is duplicated in the run, and discarded in the analysis. The drift standard is introduced after 10 samples in the run sequence, and measured as if it were a sample. Memory correction routines in FLIIMP will minimize memory from previous injections, and thus no duplication of sample vials is required. The resulting setup of the run is shown in Fig. 3. Figure 5: Vial setup for a typical freshwater run, using wide range of standards (EVAP2, GLW) and drift standard near sample isotope value (DI2). Special treatment for saltwater samples Repeated measurement of samples containing dissolved salts (sea water, brine, etc.) will lead to increased syringe wear and buildup of salt in the vapourizer. Salt buildup can increase memory and clog valves and filters over time . It is therefore important to prevent salt from entering the vapourizer by adding a salt mesh in the vapourizer septum port, and to add wash cycles in the autosampler setup. In detail, important differences to regular freshwater run are: Figure 6: Vial setup for a typical saltwater run, using narrower range of standards (EVAP2, DI2) and drift standard near sample isotope value (BERM). Protocol for saltwater stable isotope analysis on Picarro Liquid run setup salt water 1. Prepare standards - Use BERM for drift - Use DI2 and EVAP2 for sample calibration - Prepare once for a whole set of runs, using inset vials (300 uL) 2. Run setup - Sequence from DI2 to BERM to EVAP2 - Define blocks of 8 samples - Insert BERM as drift standard after 8 samples - Repeat 3x for total 24 samples, with 2 drift samples in between, takes up 29 spots - Rinse syringe with extra sample in position #43, after 10 samples 3. Select method - Single wet peak, requires 2 extra injections, peak goes to waste (salt) - FARLAB_Rinse_2, strokes, small injection 4. Number of Injections - Standards: 14 injections (12 in data file) - Samples: 8 injections (6 in data file) 5. Rinsing method - 5 injections, results in one small injection of rinse sample due to single wet peak routine 6. Equipment cleaning - Salt mesh exchanged after 24 samples, clean in ultrasonic bath, dry in glass oven, keep with septa - Septum washed after each run, exchanged if needed after inspection - Syringe washing in DI before and after run, repeated strokes until flow is smooth, moving plunger up and down over whole volume Protocol for cleaning of Picarro Vapourizer Cleaning the Picarro vapourizer cleaning is at times necessary to remove salt residue that builds up from saltwater liquid sample analysis, typically over several weeks. The cleaning procedure takes several hours, and should typically run over night. Preparation and actual cleaning are most conveniently started after lunch, and take 1h for preparation and cooldown, and about 1h for cleaning the vapourizer. Specific steps for vapourizer cleaning: At the end of the cleaning sequence, humidty goes to 2-5 ppmv. Normally the software should finish by itself, but it may be ok to terminate it when acceptable humidity levels have been reached (below 10 ppmv).
